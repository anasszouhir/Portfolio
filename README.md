# Portfolio
This is my first attempt at a portfolio
i have a design that i will be trying to achieve so lets do this.

1. clone the directory into my laptop 
2. create all the necessary files (index.html and css)
3. check the design and identify all the elements i need to create.
4. header, hero, 3 containers, footer.
5. i need to download 1 image to use.
6. i need to check out how i can make css round corners. 

i feel like this should be a good start. Lets go !
